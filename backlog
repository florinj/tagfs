* umlaute in taggings are not handled correctly :bug:
currently tagfs kicks umlaute from tag directory names. but removing umlaute
is only done when listing directories.

this also applies for anything which is not ascii.
* modifications in .tag files should be applied live                :feature:
currently you have to remount tagfs in order to apply modifications in .tag
files. tagfs should watch the .tag files for modifications and apply the
changes immediately.
