---------------------------------------------------------------------
Logging

You can enable logging by setting a debug environment variable before you
launch tagfs:
$ export DEBUG=1

tagfs will log to the console and the file /tmp/tagfs.log


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Profiling

You can enable profiling by setting a profile environment variable before you
launch tagfs:
$ export PROFILE=1

After unmounting your tagfs file system a profile file will be written. The
profile file will be written to the current directory. The profile file will
be named 'tagfs.profile'.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracing

Tracing is done via the log output. There is a utility script to analyze the
log files. To analyze a log file execute the following

$ util/trace_logfiles.py /tmp/tagfs.log

The tracing script will output some statistics.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
tar Distribution

The tagfs project contains scripts for creating source distribution packages.
To create a tar distribution package you execute the following:

$ make distsnapshot

The make call will create an archive within the target directory. The created
tar file is used for tagfs source distribution.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests

You can execute the test cases via the setup.py script in the project's root
directory.

$ python setup.py test


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Coverage

The tagfs unit tests can be executed with code coverage measurement enabled.
setup.py will measure the code coverage if the coverage lib is installed.

The coverage lib is available here: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage

If you're a debian user you can try:
$ apt-get install python-coverage

The code coverage will be written below the reports directory after executing
the test cases:
$ python setup.py test


---------------------------------------------------------------------
End-To-End Tests

tagfs contains some end-to-end tests. The end-to-end tests first mount an
items directory and afterwards execute a shell script which can assert certain
conditions in the mounted tagfs.

The end-to-end tests can be run via the setup.py:

$ python setup.py e2e_test

The end-to-end tests are located below the test/e2e directory.
