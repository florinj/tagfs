The demo subdirectory contains the file structure for a little example. It shows
what tagfs is doing and how you can use it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
tagfs is used to organize your documents using tags. tagfs requires you to
keep your files in a simple directory structure.

In our example we are organizing some holiday pictues from india and south korea.
So we create two item directories below the events directory:
* 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
* 2008-12-25 - holiday india

The names of the item directories can be anything you want but it's recommended
to add date timestamps. These timestamps allow you to have a look at your
documents in a chronological order and prevent you from specifying duplicate
names. For tagfs the timestamp is irrelevant.

Now that we have created the item directories below the event directory we can
tag them. To do so we add .tag files within them. And to make it more exciting
we add some images which represent our documents. Then we have a directory
structure like this:

events/
|-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
|   |-- .tag
|   `-- 00_IMG008.jpg
`-- 2008-12-25 - holiday india
    |-- .tag
    `-- cimg1029.jpg

In this example the directory structure below the item directories is flat. In
the real world the content and directory structure below the item directories
is not limited. Except that the tag file must be named .tag.

As already mentioned the .tag files contain the tags. The .tag file for the
south korea holiday looks like this:

holiday
airport
korea

As you can imagine we have applied three tags: holiday, airport and korea. The
tags are newline separated and can contain spaces too. Empty lines are ignored.
For the india holiday we use the following .tag file:

holiday
airport
india

Now that we have organized our documents and applied tags on them we can start
to search for our data. To do so we first mount the tagfs. Open your bash, enter
the demo directory and execute the following:

$ tagfs.py -i events tags

This will mount the tagfs below the tags directory. The event directory contains
the item directories which will be parsed for tags. As a result you will get the
following directory tree below the tags directory:

tags/
|-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea -> /demo/events/2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
|-- 2008-12-25 - holiday india -> /demo/events/2008-12-25 - holiday india
|-- airport

|       `-- airport
|           `-- 2008-12-25 - holiday india -> /demo/events/2008-12-25 - holiday india
`-- korea
    |-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea -> /demo/events/2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
    |-- airport
    |   |-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea -> /demo/events/2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
    |   `-- holiday
    |       `-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea -> /demo/events/2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
    `-- holiday
        |-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea -> /demo/events/2008-03-29 - holiday south korea
        `-- airport
            `-- 2008-03-29 - holiday south korea -> /demo/events/2008-03-29 - holiday south korea

OK... that's a lot! The idea behind the tagfs is a simple directory based filter
system. If you want to see anything relevant for the tags india you type:

$ ls -1 tags/india

The output will be:

2008-12-25 - holiday india
airport
holiday

The output will show you all item directories as links which are tagged with
india. Additionally you will see all tags which can be further combined with
india and show you further results. The tag korea is not shown as there would
be no results if you filter by india and korea.

Filtering for multiple tags at once can be done like this:

$ ls -1 tags/india/holiday

You will get the output:

2008-12-25 - holiday india
airport

I hope this explains the concept. Now it's your turn :-) Try tagfs yourself!
